## Integration Guidelines

### Authentication

All APIs are currently **public** and meant for trusted server-to-server access.

> ‚ùó Avoid exposing these APIs from public or frontend clients. Abuse may result in access blocks.

---

## üîê API Authentication (Important)

All requests must include a valid API Key in the request header.

> Missing or invalid API keys will result in a 403 Forbidden response.

### üîë Header Format

```http
Authorization: Api-Key DqZWqMQu.IzyuZ6FZu8ZRm7CJAloecnBJkzXcWf4Z
```

---

### Response Format

All endpoints return JSON. On error, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message here"
}
```

---

### Image Upload

For product request creation, images are passed as **base64 strings**. These are automatically:

- Uploaded to our media storage
- Replaced with accessible image URLs in the request payload

---

### Location-Based Data

Before submitting product or trip data, use the `/location/search/` API to autocomplete locations.
